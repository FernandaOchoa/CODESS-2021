### What is CD ?

Continuous delivery or CD for short is a collection of many prior successful agile and organizational best practices. CD focuses an organization on building a streamlined, automated software release process. At the heart of the release process is an iterative feedback loop. The feedback loop revolves around delivery of software to the end user as quickly as possible, learning from their hands-on experience, and then incorporating that feedback into the next release.
